Problem 1
Part 1)
Size:          ij D1-Cache miss rate:          ji:
4096           1.3%                           20%
2048           1.3%                           20%
512            1.5%                           19.5%
256            1.6%                           18.2%
128            2.3%                           14.8%
64             3.2%                           3.2%

The reason write order (ij vs. ji) matters is because in c, arrays are stored
with j increasing and then i increasing. Therefore, elements with the same i
are stored next to each other. 
The reason the ij writes have a lower cache miss rate (and is therefore faster)
is due to memory locality. 
With a 2D array of size 64 x 64, the access order does not matter. 

Part 2)
Size: 4096
Optimization:          ij D1-Cache miss rate:          ji:
O0                     1.3%                            20%
O1                     6.2%                            99.8%
O2                     6.2%                            99.8%
O3                     24.8%                           99.1%
